# Specification Quality Checklist: Console Todo Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:
- 6 user stories defined with P1, P2, P3 priorities
- 17 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-017)
- 8 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008)
- All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 7 edge cases identified
- Clear assumptions and out-of-scope sections
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- No implementation details (Python, Rich library mentions are in constitution, not spec)

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- All requirements align with constitution principles
- User stories are independently testable with clear priorities
